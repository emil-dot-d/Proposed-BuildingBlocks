## BB-CMU, BB-CSC-TC

## Automotive Cloud - Virtualization 
(bring up the functionality of a vehicle in a virtual environment in an internal cloud environment)

## Cloud / could also run locally on a developer (Linux) computer

## ID (unique name)

## Description
Mock platforms virtually running in a soft environment. 
Run the same test on a developer laptop & CI/CD pipeline of choice. 
RemotiveTopology’s modularity enables smoother SIL to HIL transition. 
Develop your software and test it without the target hardware in place and then move the complete solution to the vehicle a.k.a. the ”physical twin”.

## Rationale
RemotiveTopology makes it possible to test ECUs as well as doing integration testing of core computers – before you have all involved ECUs in place. 
Don’t sit around waiting for hardware, for access to HIL rigs or for other teams to complete their ECU software. 
Start testing your software straight away, on your own laptop or in a CI/CD pipeline of your choice.
